  "Ask a multiple-choice question on QUERY-IO.
   fquery-format-string and fquery-format-args are used to print the
   question. Ending the string with \"? \" is often appropriate.
   options is a plist. Defined indicators are:
   :make-complete boolean. Send a :make-complete message to the stream
     if it understands it.
   :type one of :tyi, :readline, :mini-buffer-or-readline.  It says
     how the answer is gathered and echoed.
   :choices a list of choices. A choice is either the symbol :any or
     a list.  If a list, its car is either a possible return value, or
     a list of a possible return value and how to echo it.  The
     remaining things in the list are input items that select that
     return value.  For a :readline type call, they should be strings.
     For a :tyi type call, they should be characters.  Example
     choice (for :readline): ((:foo \"Foo\") #F #\\space)
   :fresh-line boolean.  Send a :fresh-line to the stream initially.
   :condition symbol.  Signalled before asking.
   :list-choices boolean.  If T, a list of choices is printed after
     the question.
   :beep boolean. If t, we beep before printing the message.
   :clear-input boolean. If t, we discard type-ahead before printing the message.
   :select boolean.  Select the window and select back.
   :help-function specifies a function to be called if the user types
     help. It is called with stream, choices and type-function as arguments.
   :stream stream or expression. Specifies the stream to use.  If it
     is a symbol (which is not an io-stream) or a list it is
     evaluated.  Default is to use query-io."

  "List of active resume handlers and active Common LISP restarts.
   For example, (<resume-handler1> <resume-handler2>
   (<restart1> <restart2>) (<restart3>) <resume-handler4>) A condition
   handler, or the debugger, can say to resume with a specified
   resume-type keyword.  The innermost resume handler for the
   specified keyword which is applicable to the condition being
   handled will be invoked.  The resume handler is supposed to do a
   throw.  Similarly, a handler or the debugger can resume with a
   specified restart name.  The innermost Common LISP restart which
   has the specified restart name is invoked.

* A resume handler is established with each use of the resume macros, such as,
CONDITION-RESUME, ERROR-RESTART, ERROR-RESTART-LOOP, CATCH-ERROR-RESTART.
  A resume handler is a list of 5 or more elements:
 (CONDITION-NAMES KEYWORD PREDICATE (FORMAT-STRING FORMAT-ARGS...) HANDLER EXTRA-ARGS...).
where
CONDITION-NAMES is a condition name or list of such, or NIL for all conditions.
 This works the same way as CONDITION-NAMES does in EH:*CONDITION-HANDLERS* in
 that it says which conditions this handler is applicable to.
KEYWORD is the resume-type.  This item forms the name of the resume handler.  It
 could be an explicit keyword or could be a cons containing the format-string and
 format-args of a resume macro such as, CATCH-ERROR-RESTART.
PREDICATE is called with one argument, the condition,
 and if the result is non-NIL, this handler is active for this condition.
 PREDICATE can be T, meaning handler is always active if CONDITION-NAMES match.
FORMAT-STRING and FORMAT-ARGS are used to print a message saying what this
 resume handler is intended for.
HANDLER is what to do if the debugger actually says to use this resume handler.
EXTRA-ARGS are passed to HANDLER, after the condition object which is its first arg.
 Any additional values returned from the condition handler or from
 the :PROCEED-ASKING-USER operation (not including the proceed-type)
 are also passed to HANDLER, following the EXTRA-ARGS.
- A resume handler can also be just T, which means don't look past here when
looking for a resume handler for an unhandled SIGNAL on a non-error condition.

* Common LISP restarts are established with use of the Common LISP restart
macros, RESTART-BIND, RESTART-CASE and WITH-SIMPLE-RESTART.  The set of restarts
established in a restart macro is called a restart cluster.  A restart cluster
is a list of restart objects.
Each restart object is a defstruct with 4 slot items:
  RESTART-NAME, RESTART-FUNCTION, RESTART-REPORT-FUNCTION and
RESTART-INTERACTIVE-FUNCTION.
where
RESTART-NAME is the name of the restart.
RESTART-FUNCTION is the function to invoke if the restart is selected in the
 debugger.
RESTART-REPORT-FUNCTION is used to print a description explaining what this
 restart is for.
RESTART-INTERACTIVE-FUNCTION is used to prompt the user for values which are
 passed along to the restart-function to be invoked.
